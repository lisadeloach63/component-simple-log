SimpleLog is powered by [Supabase](https://supabase.com), so naturally a plugin is a must ðŸ˜‚!
Just follow these few simple steps to start.

## Create Integration

Navigate to [Plugin](/app/settings/plugins) page in the app, and you will be welcomed with Supabase integration immediately.

Then, select the desired project and channels to populate events from Supabase.
After **create** the integration, copy the endpoint.

## Connect with Supabase

Next, login to your [Supabase project](https://app.supabase.com/), and navigate to `Database` â†’ `Database Webhooks`.

Create a new database webhook with the table you want to log the events with. You can select any `Events` you wish to trigger. In this example below, I've selected `users` table, and only log the `Insert` event in SimpleLog.

Lastly, change the Method to `POST`, and paste in the URL field with the endpoint you copied just now.
You can also add `notify` parameter to `true/false`. (default to `true`).

Awesome! You've create an integration with Supabase, and it will notify you when there's a change in Supabase table!
